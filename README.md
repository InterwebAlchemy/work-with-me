# Work w/ Me

[WorkWithMe.app](https://workwithme.app/)

This is a simple Supabase and Next.js app that allows GitHub users to share psychometric personality
profile information with their colleagues.

Work w/ Me URLs use the same GitHub username, for example:

- **GitHub Profile**: `https://github.com/ericrallen/`
- **Work w/ Me Profile**: `https://workwithme.app/ericrallen/`

## Usage

Log in via GitHub and then add the psychometrics you would like to share to your profile.
